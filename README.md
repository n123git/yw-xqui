# XQUI
XQUI (or XQI) is a basic powershell UI (utilising winforms so not cmd line ofc) for XtractQuery I made in 5 minutes

## How do I use this?
If you have some knowledge of cmd line usage, you can run it in script form (run the `.ps1` in source code in the same dir as XtractQuery).
But for most people, place the `.exe` in releases next to the `XtractQuery.exe` and run the `UI.exe`.

The executable requires Windows 7-11; while the script form requires Windows powershell (5.x).
