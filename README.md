# yw-xtractqueryui
A basic powershell UI for XtractQuery I made in 5 minutes

## How do I use this?
If you have some knowledge of cmd line usage, you can run it in script form (run the `.ps1` in source code in the same dir as XtractQuery).
But for most people, place the `.exe` in releases next to the `XtractQuery.exe` and run the `UI.exe`.

### Requirements
#### Script form
The script form requires Windows powershell (5.x)

### Executable
The executable requires Windows 7-11.
